This program calculates the final height and potential energy of an object thrown vertically upward based on user-provided inputs such as mass, initial height, and initial velocity. It utilizes the equations of motion under constant acceleration due to gravity to determine the final position and potential energy of the object. Usage: Enter the mass of the object in kilograms. Input the initial height in meters from which the object was thrown. Provide the initial speed of the object in meters per second. The program then computes and displays the final height attained by the object as well as its potential energy.
